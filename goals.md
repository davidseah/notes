# Goal 2019

- mastery
- Good bod. no tummy at all. 

Atomic Habits

Focus on daily routine instead of big goals
Break goals into small sub goals

Definition of a Goal
Goals
- Grow my Technical Blog
- 65kg

Work backwards? 
now I am 75kg
incremental goal does not work well with me. 
The reason is that my apporach is not good to start off with. So I am just pushing harder for a greater result.
While this works, it is not ideal. 
Just like losing weight. 
I think I faced this multiple times in my life. 
Instead of running, cutting down on food. 
And see my weight jumping up and down,
try something totally radical. 
The impact should be immediate and radical. 
That is because this is the way of life. 
If you are following the way of how life is, it works. 
Nature always work. 
If it doesn't work, it is because of the perverse nature of human.
Think about this, there are people that have their life totally changed. 
What is the reason? Is it because they are doing the same thing but harder this time? 
I will say most likely No. 
It is most probable that they did something radical. 
totally different from what they have been thinking.
The bible called this the renewing of their mind. 
Of course we should be mindful of what works and dont throw things out.

Thus experimenting, reading is important. 
And also a goal. 
Cos without a goal, we don't if we even hit a target.

So first a goal.
a experiment. 
Result should be radical so is the approach.
Read up to try what has already been tried by others.
While it is difficult to follow because it is radical. 
It shouldn't feel difficult. You should be able to do it easily.

Experiment drive goals.
Experiement test what works and what doesn't work in life. 
Reading, writing and think is part of experiement. 
Collect data. 
Always reflect everyday, month, year to see what works and what doesn't work. 
After experimenting, do a evulation to 

Because there are too much data and knowledge around. 
We cannot be sloppy about data. 
We need a system to organise these data. 

1. Read, Write and think


Problem Solving
- Break down problem into smaller problems
- Break until you are so damm sure what is happening and build up again. 
- Painful but we have a responsbility to do it right 

How to be motivated
1. Have goals and a concrete plans


Pogrammer Philosphy

Am I an effective programmer?
- Does my code make people feel good? 
- Does it automate some user task?
- Does it make some user task easier?
- Does it amplify users' power?
- Does it create value?
- 10x dev that can help others be 10x more effective
- write code that is easy to understand/use/maintain
- does your code has a good bus factor? If the maintainer dies tmr, can anyone pick up where he/she left off? 

- Think Deeply about simple problems
- Test First approach
- Make sure things are as perfect as possible
- better to work on one thing perfectly than many things in a half bake status. 

How do you focus? 
I just read an article by Mayo Oshin on 
Zanshin: How to master the art of focus and concentration 
from a legendary Japanese archer

It says the way to the goal is not to be measured!
Of what importance are weeks, months, years?

Instead of focusing on the goal. 
Focus on the task at hand. 
The relax focus. 
The breathing. 

Focus on quatitative improvement.
Find out about small changes that make big differences.
This is the so call secret to life. 
Everyone successful people has them. 
It might works for everyone and it might not work. 
but I have to find out and test this changes. 
Remember it's small but quality changes. 

Think Deeply about simple problems


What is my mantra? 
I want to write code that is beautiful. When people see it, they feel a sense of beauty. 
Just like design. There is intention and mindfulness applied to it when created. 
In everything that I do, I will try to do it with intention. 
Not possible all the time but I try. 

To be a good programmer it is to be mindful of everything that is being written.
It comes with intention and a mindful though of every single line that is being written.
It might be slow but it comes with thoughts. 

Goal for Jan to March

* Our brain craves for reward, this is from our hunter instinct where we are build to survive. 
* we need whatever we need to survive and we need it now. So if given a choice, we will always choose the choice that give us a good feeling immediately. The thing is that our modern life is screw up. Many things are engineer to give us good feeling immediately. Drugs, soda, junk food ect.. And there trick our system to want to get them. But they are bad for our body. Instead, in modern life, things that are good are usually things that we defer doing. It has good long terms benefit but not short. 

* knowing this we have to trick our brain. Give it a reward for everything u want to achieve and achieve.
