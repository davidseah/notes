## How do you focus? 
The way to the goal is not to be measured!
Of what importance are weeks, months, years?

Instead of focusing on the goal. 
Focus on the task at hand. 
The relax focus. 
The breathing. 

Focus on quatitative improvement.
Find out about small changes that make big differences.
This is the so call secret to life. 
Everyone successful people has them. 
It might works for everyone and it might not work. 
but I have to find out and test this changes. 
Remember it's small but quality changes. 

Think Deeply about simple problems


* Don't focus on being the best but instead focus on being the best at learning new things
* Everything is learnable. Don't limit yourself. 
* Find ways to be effective in learning
* Be clear and focus on what you want to learn
* Have a clear roadmap
* Always check what you know and what you don't know, many times we are trapping in believing what you think you know but actually don't
* Knowledge are usually simple and easy to understand, it is humans that make it difficult to understand. Attempt to simplify things or break it down to simpler concepts
* It's okay not to understand but take note what you don't and come back again
* Don't pretend to understand when you don't, it's okay not to know something and act like a fool
* Better to understand something fully in a long time than to know something superficially in the short time, for it is base on the current understand that your future knowledge will be build upon, and in a long run, you will take a shorter time. Think long term, like really long term, 10, 20, 30 years? 
* My job is not just to do a job but to learn as much as I can
* My job now is to build career capital. 
* Find things that will be valuable 
* engage in deep work

* Ways to learn
    * Top Down
    * Down Top (First principles)
    * Methephore (Link one idea to another) 

# Things to do
* Formulalise Learning method and test it
* Find out best time and duration to learn, again experiment and keep it discipline to protect this period 


# Experiment Formula
1. Look at big picture, it's okay if you dont understand everything

# Learning To Learning
A formula to maximize 
1. Speed of learning
2. The amount retained over a period of time
3. Understanding what you learn instead of just touching the surface and pretending to learn. 
4. Difuse vs Focus Learning

Best time to learn
7am to 8am


# Learn Vulkan Experiment and log
## Plan
* go through https://vulkan-tutorial.com/
* go through Vulkan book

## Idea
* First time is to have a big picture of what is going first
* Don't expect to know everything, make use of diffuse mode
* Use Pomodoro, deep work is important

# Learning/ Deep Work
## Hypothesis amount of hours needed to learn something

### 100 hours
1 hour a day, it will take me 3 and half months

### 1000 hours
1hpd == 1000 days == 3 years
2hpd ==  500 days == 1.5 years

Let experiment with 100 hours. 
I am going test it with learning Vulkan. 
I can safely says that I have suse about 6 hours? 
This means a total of 94 hours left. 
I have two more weeks to the workshop. 
so 94/14 = 6.7 hours. 
I need to invest 6.7 hours everyday. hmmm
seems hard. 


# Learning effectively
Stages
1. Novice
2. Advance beginner
3. competent 
4. proficient
5. expert 

# Novice 
Don't know anything
rely on clear instructions
need to follow someone recpies in order to complete the task
can only follow insturction and get derailed very very easily. 
blame recipe and without a good system to troubleshoot on my own, can get stuck

# advance beginner
Can troubleshoot their problem and work on your own
Still primarily using recipes but have more context when to use which recipes


### Become Expert
* Novice
    * First level of skill acquisition, where you are just getting started in the skill and have little familiarity with it
    * Reliance on recipes
    * Need clear instructions on how to do something in order to do it.
    * They don't have an intuitive understanding of the skills, so they need someone else's recipes to follow in order to complete any task within the skill. 
* Advance Beginner Stage
    * Becomes an advanced beginner when they can start to troubleshoot their problems and work on their own. 
    * They are still primary using recipes but they have more contextual awareness of when to use which recipes. 
* Competent Stage
    *  You have a better sense of what is relevant and what isn't. 
    * You can draw on a wide collection of recipes based on those situation rules. 
* Proficient Stage
    * Inituitive sense of what the goal should be given the situation. 
    * While compentent has to create and find rules for what to do in a situation, proficient has an intuitive sense of what the goal should be but not necessarily exactly how to do it. 
* Expert
    * Pure inituition

Going from Novice to expert
* Going from Zero to Novice
    * At this stage focus on collecting recipes. 
    * You should be reading books, blogs listening to speecheds, taking classes, whatever will give you a large repertoire of recipes as fast aspossble. 
    * But you can't be just reading them, you have to apply them. 
* Going from novice to advanceed beginner
    * Now that you have collected a large database of recipes and started applying them, you should begin to develop some contextual understanding of when to use which recipes. 
    * Start looking for more maxims and applying them to your practice and see if they make sense to you
    * try to change things in them and see what happens.
    * make your own versions of the recipes by piecing togther different recipes and looking up help as you need it. 
* Going from advanced beginner to competent
    * At this point you should have a large repertoire of recipes and maxims that you can applys. 
    * But not a lot of clarity around what is important in deciding which ones to uses. 
    * You might get overwhelmed by decisions easily and as a result revert to simply following a recipe and hoping you get lucky. 
    * You need to start trying to figure out what data and information is important and what isn't. 
* going from competent to proficient



How to learn something efficiently? 
I think I have difficulty learning or understand new concept.  
I used to think that it is my fault but is it really?
I am not super smart, I am sure there are people that can learn something easily. 
But I susepect that 90% of the so call smart people, they have tools or ways to learn things that make it appear that they are smart.
One reason is the context, it's hard to learn something without context. Terminology, background knowledge are neccessary. You just can't learn calculs without first understand plus and minus. So when someone is being thrown some concept, if they do not understand that does not means that they are stupid but rather they do not have the neccessary background knowledge needed at the point for them to understand. 
One way to fix this is to read alot. I mean alot. Grab any knowledge that you can possible get hold of. Having someone to talk to really helps. 
Another reason is that people are just not good at explaining or communicating. If you dont understand something, dont always assume it is your fault. It might be the other party. So take it easy on yourself. And the point of reading from multiple source helps. Eventually if you find hard enough you will have someone that is able to explain things easily. 
The pinnicle of knowledge is that you are able to explain difficult things at an easy way that layman can understand. 
You will need to have a proactive approach.
1. Find and gather as many resoruces
2. sort and classify them
3. read them even if you dont understand
4. read alot so you get how things are explain from different people
5. Talk to people, it might help especially if you are close to an expert
6. Knowledge compunds
7. It will get much easier the more you know
8. It might be hard to get knowledge but the more you know from other discipline, the easier you can cross reference
9. Learn to communicate thsi understanding clearly and simply. 

To be a good programmer/ arthitect, you need to manage trade off. To be able to mamage trade off you need to have a bunch of things that you know to choose from. If you only know 1 way of doing things then there are no alternative. And in that case, there is no way to decide. Of course having a group of people discussing something helps. 

SO the algorithm for learning goes like this
1. Have something you are motivated to learn
2. Gather all possible resouce you can
3. Sort them 
4. Read as many as possible
5. Be focus on the topic and try not to branch off
6. You dont need to know every trees
7. Talk to people if possible
8. Communicate finding as simply as possible such that layman can even know if possible. 
9. Find out what is missing from the explationation and identify things that you are still unsure. Repeat process on topic. If you are happy with the explanation. Stop.
10. This is hardwork. Iteration will take some time. 

Example
1. learn calculse
2. Gather all topics
3. Read materials.
4. Explain
5. shit dont really get what is plus and minus
6. Go and find out what is plus and minus
7. FInd out about that 
8. Try explaining plus and minus
9. Go back to calculs. 


we can try to compare to other way of doing it and see the advantage. 
And play around with things and see the differences. 
Come out with rules and mantra. 

I think it is important to narrow the scope as much as possible. Dont try to go for the nitty gritty details. It is impossible to know every parts of the tree and you will lose motivation after a while. Instead focus in on the things you want to learn, and try to zoom in as much as possible with deveiating from your goal. 

I think it is very important to have a defined scope whenever you want to learn something. 
So currently I am trying to learn Vulkan. What is Vulkan excalty? There are hundred or thousands of parts to it. So instead of saying I want to learn Vulkan. Maybe a better goal will be to, I want to draw a triangle with Vulkan. I want to draw a model with Vulkan. At least there will be an end goal or some sort of motivation to finish it? But of cos the process will be the same. Reading lots of stuff but at least 


I need to be as good as the google/nivida/amd guys. But how?
1. Communication skills
2. Proactiveness? 
3. Initative?

How to create a career
* Don't chase things like money , status, job title and promotions. 
Universal Skills
1. Self Discipline
2. Personal Effectiveness
3. Communication
4. Negotiation
5. Persuasion
6. Physical Strength and stamina
7. Flexibility

But I susepect that 90% of the so call smart people, they have tools or ways to learn things that make it appear that they are smart.

Study System
- Read through the content page
- Read through the content one time quickly
- It is okay that you understand everything. As you often do. 
- Then go back to content again. 
- This time read it line by line slowly. Ask yourself if you understand the sentences 100% percent. 
- Do not cheat yourself. If you don't, ask yourself why, what information is missing. Trace back to the missing information. And repeat again, until you fully understand. 
- Next try to explain to yourself the concept like how you would explain to a 5 year old kid. No terminlogy. 
- explain as simply as you can. If you can't go back to what u find it hard to explain simply and disect it to simpler terms. 
- Repeat the process. 
- Write a blog about the topic then. 

How do you focus? 
I just read an article by Mayo Oshin on 
Zanshin: How to master the art of focus and concentration 
from a legendary Japanese archer

It says the way to the goal is not to be measured!
Of what importance are weeks, months, years?

Instead of focusing on the goal. 
Focus on the task at hand. 
The relax focus. 
The breathing. 

Focus on quatitative improvement.
Find out about small changes that make big differences.
This is the so call secret to life. 
Everyone successful people has them. 
It might works for everyone and it might not work. 
but I have to find out and test this changes. 
Remember it's small but quality changes. 

Am I an effective programmer?
- Does my code make people feel good? 
- Does it automate some user task?
- Does it make some user task easier?
- Does it amplify users' power?
- Does it create value?
- 10x dev that can help others be 10x more effective
- write code that is easy to understand/use/maintain
- does your code has a good bus factor? If the maintainer dies tmr, can anyone pick up where he/she left off? 

Daily Log
What is my mantra? 
I want to write code that is beautiful. When people see it, they feel a sense of beauty. 
Just like design. There is intention and mindfulness applied to it when created. 
In everything that I do, I will try to do it with intention. 
Not possible all the time but I try. 

I am not determine by my tools but my mind. 
I am not sure how to improve my mind, but I will do all things to improve the level of thinking/communication. 

okay... shouldn't have go for lunch. But that is life right?

Daily Log
To be a good programmer it is to be mindful of everything that is being written.
It comes with intention and a mindful though of every single line that is being written.
It might be slow but it comes with thoughts. 

hilosophy of programming
- Easy to understand code
- Code with clear intention
- manage complexity, able to manage between current code and future code
- as optimize as possible with the effort given
- complexity in terms of run time
- and complexity in terms of cognitive, syntax, boilerplate, indirection
- we humans are program in a way to always look for the easiest way to do something, if it gets too hard
    we tune out. It is like answering 1+1, we can immediately answer it but what if it is 49 * 49, we can for sure still answer it but it start to justific if it is worth the extra energy. 
    Good programs should not fall into this stage. But it takes experience and energy and time to manage this. 
    one way to manage this is to break things into smaller parts, so 49*49 can be broken into 7 * 7 * 7 * 7.
    We just have to be more intentional with the things that we are doing, instead of letting things run to its course. 

Daily Log
- the only way to move up is to be able to communicate effectively both verbally and in writing. 
    It is the skill that can be improve over a period of years and not worried that things will be obsolete. 
    That is why I need to improve on my writing skill and verbal communication. 
    My weakness is that I have no idea how grammar works. And my spelling sucks. 
    To add to insult, my pronuciation is bad. 
    So issues
    1. Lack of a strong grasp in grammar
    2. weak spelling skills
    3. Poor pronuciation of words

    So how do I fix this? 
    - I can do a little a day, improve a little a day, my target will be 5 years maybe? 
    - To be a world class communicator.
