## How do you focus? 
The way to the goal is not to be measured!
Of what importance are weeks, months, years?

Instead of focusing on the goal. 
Focus on the task at hand. 
The relax focus. 
The breathing. 

Focus on quatitative improvement.
Find out about small changes that make big differences.
This is the so call secret to life. 
Everyone successful people has them. 
It might works for everyone and it might not work. 
but I have to find out and test this changes. 
Remember it's small but quality changes. 

Think Deeply about simple problems


* Don't focus on being the best but instead focus on being the best at learning new things
* Everything is learnable. Don't limit yourself. 
* Find ways to be effective in learning
* Be clear and focus on what you want to learn
* Have a clear roadmap
* Always check what you know and what you don't know, many times we are trapping in believing what you think you know but actually don't
* Knowledge are usually simple and easy to understand, it is humans that make it difficult to understand. Attempt to simplify things or break it down to simpler concepts
* It's okay not to understand but take note what you don't and come back again
* Don't pretend to understand when you don't, it's okay not to know something and act like a fool
* Better to understand something fully in a long time than to know something superficially in the short time, for it is base on the current understand that your future knowledge will be build upon, and in a long run, you will take a shorter time. Think long term, like really long term, 10, 20, 30 years? 
* My job is not just to do a job but to learn as much as I can
* My job now is to build career capital. 
* Find things that will be valuable 
* engage in deep work

* Ways to learn
    * Top Down
    * Down Top (First principles)
    * Methephore (Link one idea to another) 

# Things to do
* Formulalise Learning method and test it
* Find out best time and duration to learn, again experiment and keep it discipline to protect this period 


# Experiment Formula
1. Look at big picture, it's okay if you dont understand everything

# Learning To Learning
A formula to maximize 
1. Speed of learning
2. The amount retained over a period of time
3. Understanding what you learn instead of just touching the surface and pretending to learn. 
4. Difuse vs Focus Learning

Best time to learn
7am to 8am


# Learn Vulkan Experiment and log
## Plan
* go through https://vulkan-tutorial.com/
* go through Vulkan book

## Idea
* First time is to have a big picture of what is going first
* Don't expect to know everything, make use of diffuse mode
* Use Pomodoro, deep work is important

# Learning/ Deep Work
## Hypothesis amount of hours needed to learn something

### 100 hours
1 hour a day, it will take me 3 and half months

### 1000 hours
1hpd == 1000 days == 3 years
2hpd ==  500 days == 1.5 years

Let experiment with 100 hours. 
I am going test it with learning Vulkan. 
I can safely says that I have suse about 6 hours? 
This means a total of 94 hours left. 
I have two more weeks to the workshop. 
so 94/14 = 6.7 hours. 
I need to invest 6.7 hours everyday. hmmm
seems hard.
