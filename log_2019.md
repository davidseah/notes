## 4 Jan 2019
To Do List
- Understand RSDL Dependency 
- Read through entire logic

Study System
- Read through the content page
- Read through the content one time quickly
- It is okay that you understand everything. As you often do. 
- Then go back to content again. 
- This time read it line by line slowly. Ask yourself if you understand the sentences 100% percent. 
- Do not cheat yourself. If you don't, ask yourself why, what information is missing. Trace back to the missing information. And repeat again, until you fully understand. 
- Next try to explain to yourself the concept like how you would explain to a 5 year old kid. No terminlogy. 
- explain as simply as you can. If you can't go back to what u find it hard to explain simply and disect it to simpler terms. 
- Repeat the process. 
- Write a blog about the topic then.

2 Week of 2019
Alight... First week was okay... I did pretty alright in pomodoro. 
i hit at least 8T everyday, except for Friday. Okay my bad. 
But even though I was not focusing on the productivity of my work I actually got more productive. 
So can I safely say that focus work is equal to productivity? 
One more thing I notice that, I am done with my task on Thursday. So Friday, I was feeling alittle less motivated and to some extend did not really know what should I focus my work on. 
I think having sepcific and just a little challenging task is important for productivity. 
Uncertaintly, easy or over challenging stuff overwhelms me. 

So the next time, when I am working on something, I need to be aware. 

1. Task has to be specific. 
2. Task has to be just right skillswise. 
    If it is too easy, just quickly do it. 
    too difficult, see if I can break it down into easier things. 

# 7 Jan 2019
To Do list
1. Go through the source code for RSDL... 
2. precept by precept make sure I know every single line. 

Daily Log
I am looking into RSDL right now. 
So the question is what do I wish to achieve by the end of this? 
big statement, I want to understand every single line. 
What it does and why was it written in such a manner.
this is funny consider that I am the one that wrote it.
But I have touch it for some time. 
So this will be a good touch. 
Also, I should not be afraid of changing code if neccessary. 

What is the differences between GBT_tstMSrfcDesc and GBT_tstMSurface? 

I seriously need to consider reducing the number of containers. 
Place that need to seriously consider reducing
- Dependency


what is the differences between pair and map?
- you need to use pair if you use insert for map

Daily Log
It's already the first day of Feb. 
One month has gone, and we are left with another 11 months. 
I think I need to slow down and think. 
What is important and what is not.
Somehow I had this dream last night. 
It is better to go slow in the right direction than fast in the wrong direction. 
Many times when we are going to fast, we failed to stop and think, am I in the right direction. 
Of course, if you are in the right direction, good for you. But what if you are wrong? 
It might take a longer time to turn back than if you are heading in the right direction but at a slower pace in the first pace. Be more delibrate in your intend and stop going with the flow.

### Become Expert
* Novice
    * First level of skill acquisition, where you are just getting started in the skill and have little familiarity with it
    * Reliance on recipes
    * Need clear instructions on how to do something in order to do it.
    * They don't have an intuitive understanding of the skills, so they need someone else's recipes to follow in order to complete any task within the skill. 
* Advance Beginner Stage
    * Becomes an advanced beginner when they can start to troubleshoot their problems and work on their own. 
    * They are still primary using recipes but they have more contextual awareness of when to use which recipes. 
* Competent Stage
    *  You have a better sense of what is relevant and what isn't. 
    * You can draw on a wide collection of recipes based on those situation rules. 
* Proficient Stage
    * Inituitive sense of what the goal should be given the situation. 
    * While compentent has to create and find rules for what to do in a situation, proficient has an intuitive sense of what the goal should be but not necessarily exactly how to do it. 
* Expert
    * Pure inituition

Going from Novice to expert
* Going from Zero to Novice
    * At this stage focus on collecting recipes. 
    * You should be reading books, blogs listening to speecheds, taking classes, whatever will give you a large repertoire of recipes as fast aspossble. 
    * But you can't be just reading them, you have to apply them. 
* Going from novice to advanceed beginner
    * Now that you have collected a large database of recipes and started applying them, you hsould begin to develop some contextual understanding of when to use which recipes. 
    * Start looking for more maxims and applying them to your practice and see if they make sense to you
    * try to change things in them and see what happens.
    * make your own versions of the recipes by piecing togther different recipes and looking up help as you need it. 
* Going from advanced beginner to competent
    * At this point you should have a large repertoire of recipes and maxims that you can applys. 
    * But not a lot of clarity around what is important in deciding which ones to uses. 
    * You might get overwhelmed by decisions easily and as a result revert to simply following a recipe and hoping you get lucky. 
    * You need to start trying to figure out what data and information is important and what isn't. 
* going from competent to proficient

* Build it?

How to learn something efficiently? 
I think I have difficulty learning or understand new concept.  
I used to think that it is my fault but is it really?
I am not super smart, I am sure there are people that can learn something easily. 
But I susepect that 90% of the so call smart people, they have tools or ways to learn things that make it appear that they are smart.
One reason is the context, it's hard to learn something without context. Terminology, background knowledge are neccessary. You just can't learn calculs without first understand plus and minus. So when someone is being thrown some concept, if they do not understand that does not means that they are stupid but rather they do not have the neccessary background knowledge needed at the point for them to understand. 
One way to fix this is to read alot. I mean alot. Grab any knowledge that you can possible get hold of. Having someone to talk to really helps. 
Another reason is that people are just not good at explaining or communicating. If you dont understand something, dont always assume it is your fault. It might be the other party. So take it easy on yourself. And the point of reading from multiple source helps. Eventually if you find hard enough you will have someone that is able to explain things easily. 
The pinnicle of knowledge is that you are able to explain difficult things at an easy way that layman can understand. 
You will need to have a proactive approach.
1. Find and gather as many resoruces
2. sort and classify them
3. read them even if you dont understand
4. read alot so you get how things are explain from different people
5. Talk to people, it might help especially if you are close to an expert
6. Knowledge compunds
7. It will get much easier the more you know
8. It might be hard to get knowledge but the more you know from other discipline, the easier you can cross reference
9. Learn to communicate thsi understanding clearly and simply.

### Log
I am kinda scared. not sur why. But it is during this period that is the most critical. 
This is where my values comes in. 
1. effection Learning
2. Quality, have a high standard
3. curosity

It is important to have an independent thinking. 
This is to ensure that where you are going is in the right direction.
Then next is to focus. Focus allows you to bring whatever limited energy you have to the right place.
The more you work on the right place, the more compound effects you will get. 
And work hard, after you can get the first two out
