I like how visual studio looks. So I am attempting to do my logs over here instead of notebook.
Today I will like to focus on finding out why the OTSubControl table is not exported out in RSSTE. I wish to finish this in 7 Tomato. So I have to be really focus. 

Possible Cause
- RSSTE is not reading Hebrew script properly
- GDef in XML is wrong

Strategy
- Should I check how GS4 is handling OT Sub control? 
- Maybe I should see the sequence. 
- Maybe do a documentation on it


Generating OTSubControl in GS4
This is what is in GBT_tstOTScript

struct GBT_tstOTScript
{
    GBT__tstChainSubCache   *pstSubstitution;
    GBT__tstMarkBaseCache   *pstMarkToBaseTable;
    GBT__tstMarkBaseCache   *pstMarkToMarkTable;
    GBT__tstOTArab          *pstArabicShaping;
}

struct GBT_tstOTSubControl
{
    GBT_tstOTScript         *apstScript[GBT__nNumberOfScriptsToProcess];
    uint16                  *pu16ClassTable;
    GBT__tstKerningCache    *pstKerning;
}
Call stack when allocating memory for 
FNTEG_pstFTCreateFont->FNTEG_boLoadLayoutTables->FNTEG_boAllocateClassCache->FNTEG_vLoadMarkClass

[0] = {u32OTScript=1818326126 u32OTLanguage=1145457748 u16ScriptCache=0 }
[1] = {u32OTScript=1634885986 u32OTLanguage=1145457748 u16ScriptCache=1 }
[2] = {u32OTScript=1952997737 u32OTLanguage=1145457748 u16ScriptCache=2 }
[3] = {u32OTScript=1751474802 u32OTLanguage=1145457748 u16ScriptCache=3 }


code crash at font_resource_maps.clear().....
or is it at dat_index_maps.clear()

okay let's see
okay I have verified that call clear on an empty map should not crash the system. 


okay I have some clue
it_fonts.pstOTSubControl is allocated memory in thai

After elimintaing many possiblity, the issue lies in the script table is not being fill up. 
Why? I dont know. 

Code wrong or input wrong

u32Language = 1145457748


u32Script = 1818326126
u32Version	256	unsigned long
u16ScriptList	2560	unsigned short
u16FeatureList	21504	unsigned short
u16LookupList	36864	unsigned short


u32Language = 1145457748
u32Script = 1751474802


u32Version	256	unsigned long
u16ScriptList	2560	unsigned short
u16FeatureList	9216	unsigned short
u16LookupList	12800	unsigned short

at this point I am so tired
Question will be is it possible to just use Gdef without GSub?
So the font that Toyota gave us does not have GSub


Things to do
* check if Hacked toyota font works
* check if anything can be done to by pass GSUB
* Read up about dynamic Memory
* SOS
* Debug DN8? 
* Split Font files/GLTF Files into different group 

# 1 Nov 2018
Can't believe it is already the start of Nov

Anyhow got to be focus. 

What is the goal of today? 
I think it will be to split rsst. into different group. 
and test it. especially with the special fonts. 

What is excatly inside GPOS, GSub and GDef? 
This will be my target today. 
Maybe will spend around 1-2 Tomato. 


Okay, unfortunetely the generated toyota XML does not works. Sad. It went into an infinite loop. 
I have to investigate it. 

Static Hebrew Text from Google is in a infite loop
Hypothesis
> We should not add Latin in the script. reason is because latin is being check but,the gsub tables does not have hebrew and for some reasons It went into a endless loop. 
> verify and it is correct. But not sure why this happens. Have to debug deeper to find out why.
> Check what is really happening. 
> I think we should be able to replicate the same issue in FT font

I always, always.... have this problem that I cannot find a testcase to test my fonts rendering. Why why why!

The MarkLigPosFormat1 subtable begins with 
a format identifier
two offsets (markCoverage Offset, baseCoverageOffset) to coverage tables that list all the mark glyphs (MarkCoverage) and Ligature Glyphs (ligatureCoverage)
referenced in the subtable.

What on earth is coverage?

- Reply Ulrich (Done)
- check RSSTE part (Not Done)
- See what should we proceed to do?

Mark To Ligature 
with markToBase attachment, described previously, each base glyph has an attachment point defined for each class of marks. 
markToLigature attachment is similar, except that each ligature glyoh is defined to have multiple components.
Each component has a seperate set of attachment points defined for the different mark classes. 

As a result, a ligature glyph may have multiple base attachment points for one class of marks. 

For a given mark assigned to a particular class, the appropriate base attachment point is determined by which ligature component the mark is associated with. 

This is dependent on the original character sting and subsequent characteror glyph sequence processing, not  the font alone. 
While a text-layout client is performing any character-based preprocessing or glyph substition operations using the GSUB table, the text layout client must keep track of association of marks to particular ligature glyph components. 

Example:
Assume 2 mark classes: all marks positioned above base glyphs(Calss 0), and all marks positioned below base glyphs(class 1)

How do you focus? 
I just read an article by Mayo Oshin on 
Zanshin: How to master the art of focus and concentration 
from a legendary Japanese archer

It says the way to the goal is not to be measured!
Of what importance are weeks, months, years?

Instead of focusing on the goal. 
Focus on the task at hand. 
The relax focus. 
The breathing. 

Focus on quatitative improvement.
Find out about small changes that make big differences.
This is the so call secret to life. 
Everyone successful people has them. 
It might works for everyone and it might not work. 
but I have to find out and test this changes. 
Remember it's small but quality changes.

This is the last week of the PI and I have to get things to be done. 
The transformation is a pain in the ass because of the fact that I have to do calculation and I am pretty bad with it.
But you just got to do what you got to do. 
Also I have to plan for the traveling from Narita to Downtown Japan. 
A pain in the ass again, again I got to do what I got to do. 

The transformation is getting shit difficult. 
I am not even sure at this point should I even be pursing over it. 
Can it be done? 
I am not entirely sure. 
If it cannot be done, I have to discuss on why it cannot be done.

To be a good programmer it is to be mindful of everything that is being written.
It comes with intention and a mindful though of every single line that is being written.
It might be slow but it comes with thoughts. 

Yesterday was a bad day in terms of tomato. 
I think I need to realign my focus. 
And go back to the plan. Follow it as closely as I can.
Forget about the result. For the result is not in my control. 
What I can do is the process. 

I have to keep a collection of my skill set

Things to improve on.

philosophy of programming
- Easy to understand code
- Code with clear intention
- manage complexity, able to manage between current code and future code
- as optimize as possible with the effort given
- complexity in terms of run time
- and complexity in terms of cognitive, syntax, boilerplate, indirection
- we humans are program in a way to always look for the easiest way to do something, if it gets too hard
    we tune out. It is like answering 1+1, we can immediately answer it but what if it is 49 * 49, we can for sure still answer it but it start to justific if it is worth the extra energy. 
    Good programs should not fall into this stage. But it takes experience and energy and time to manage this. 
    one way to manage this is to break things into smaller parts, so 49*49 can be broken into 7 * 7 * 7 * 7.
    We just have to be more intentional with the things that we are doing, instead of letting things run to its course.

- the only way to move up is to be able to communicate effectively both verbally and in writing. 
    It is the skill that can be improve over a period of years and not worried that things will be obsolete. 
    That is why I need to improve on my writing skill and verbal communication. 
    My weakness is that I have no idea how grammar works. And my spelling sucks. 
    To add to insult, my pronuciation is bad. 
    So issues
    1. Lack of a strong grasp in grammar
    2. weak spelling skills
    3. Poor pronuciation of words

    So how do I fix this? 
    - I can do a little a day, improve a little a day, my target will be 5 years maybe? 
    - To be a world class communicator.

A 2018 year of reflection
How is 2018 going for me? 
A good aspect is that I managed to reduce to student loan to under $25K but I must admit that I kinda over spent.
For work wise it is good that I started working on 3D. But it is not to the effect that I wanted. 
I think I should really document or start blogging so that I can look back with acccomplishment. 

Pomodoro Log
I am not able to focus, I must admit. 
I hope that with the help of pomodoro, I can improve my focus.
Treat work as a form of medidation. 
Single task work. 25 mins at a time.

1st Tomato
What did I do?
- Attempted to do a rotation using glm::rotation

What should I focus next? 
1. Check if my glm is in radian or degrees (in radian)
2. check how concatenation of scale and rotate affect the inverse matrix. 
3. check what about multiple concatenation. 

2nd Tomato
What did I do?
- Managed to verify that it is indeed radian 
- Check Rotation in GLM using Quat and Rotation but somehow it is incorrect. 

What should I do next?
- check with real PI/2
- check with PI.

OMG... It is the last day of the year.... 
I still have this shitting problem to solve.. or else it will be actually an home run. I guess you can't have everything in life. 
Maybe just write a reflection on 2018. How was it? And what lessons can I actually bring with it. 
I think one thing that I managed to breakthrough is in terms of writing and public speaking. 
Both from the same event, helping to promote the company which I was reluctant initially. 
But I guess, I am glad I took up the pludge. 

Work has been a rollar coaster. Ribhu left the company so, there are mant slack to pick it up from. 
I think I am actually declining in terms of my programming skills. 
But I guess I made it up in terms of thinking. 
I need to be more focus. And I think one way to focus is to actually document down what did I do. 
I think I will do that more often next year. Document every single hour of my work life. 
This kinda spur me to do more? 

SO what is my goal today? 
Let us explore my programming philosophy again. 
It is not good just to be doing things the way that it is. 
Or to do things to to see it end. 
There needs to be certain quality about it. 
Accurate is the most important factor. 
Results has to be as accurate as I possibility can. 
The rest like space and time complexcity are secondary to accurately. 
If Accuratecy is being achieve then we can consider the rest. 

Write easy to read code is important too after which. 
Code that are easy going for the congnotive. 
We spend more time reading code that actually coding. 
Then lastly will be easy to maintain. 
We do not want to be breaking things whenever we need to change or add a feature. 

So to sum it up
1. Accurate
2. Time Complexity 
3. Space COmplexity 
4. Easy Going for the conginitive
5. Easy to maintain 

To Do List
- Come out with a solution for the transformation matrix

Matrix log issue.... 
zzz... really zzz.. But I have to focus... 
Let's do with 4 tomato first and see how things goes. 

Lets see what do we have first... 
End result
Given a worldtranslate/ rotate/ scale
I will have a node that does the above transformation without the influence of the parent/grandparent transformation.
Okay this is clear. 

What have I tried? 
1. transform the position from world to local. 
    and store it as the local position. 
    - Let me verify this.
