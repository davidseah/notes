# Dreams and Vision
If money is not an issue what will I want to be doing?
I will like to have a company with a small team.
We will be working on products that will solve the needs of people while have a steady stream of income of $1 million a month. 
Everyone will be paid at least $10k so that they are free from the worry of money. 
Apart from that I can have the option of working remotely. Meaning that I can be at different places to work.
Places that I can do hiking in the morning. So my mind will be fresh from the hike.
